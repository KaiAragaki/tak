# Tak

[Tak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tak_(function)) is a simple benchmark function. This repo contains some scripts I wrote to test various language implementations.

It is defined as follows:
```py
def tak(x, y, z):
    if y < x:
        return tak(
            tak(x - 1, y, z),
            tak(y - 1, z, x),
            tak(z - 1, x, y),
        )
    else:
        return z
```

Current results - x = 48, y = 20, z = 12 - M1 MacBook Pro:

## PRs Welcome!

I'd love to build up a collection of more languages, and while I plan to implement some more myself, I won't say no to help!

The general requirements for adding a new language:
- Create a new folder for the language.
- Add the implementation - usually named `tak.foo`, where `foo` is the relevant extension.
- Add `run.sh`, which passes three arguments `$1`, `$2` and `$3` to the program.
- Add `version.sh`, which should output the current version of the language. This should come directly from the interpreter/compiler, and be a single line of output. You can use common shell tools to process the output down to one line if necessary.
- For compiled languages, add `build.sh` to generate the compiled output.
- The program must read the values of x, y, and z from `argv`.
- The program must produce some sort of output, as this makes verification and debugging easier.
- The program must implement the Tak function as specified above - I'm interested in raw performance, not the number of clever optimisations you can make.
